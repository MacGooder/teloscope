# teloscope
**Description**

This tool uses a sliding window to detect the occurences of a given string in a sequence. Teloscope can be used to find certain chains of base pairs such as the 'TTAGGG' found in the telomeres of vertebrates. Given the input of a DNA sequence and the sequence being detected, teloscope will produce the pattern coordinates in BED format.
